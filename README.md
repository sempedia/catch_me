# Catch me if you can! - simple game using tkinter and Pyhton
# 
#
# The rules are:
#
# - The game goes on between TkInter and the user.
# - We have a 500x500 pixel main window with a button inside named 'Catch me!'.
# - The button is located in the top-left corner of the window.
# - If the user moves the mouse cursor over the button, the button immediately
#   jumps to another location inside the window.
# - The button must not cross the window's boundaries during the jump!
#
# Enjoy the game!
